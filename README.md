A Mod thats adds 6 new guns, will add more (if i feel like it)

my first mod, if you say the gun quality is bad, then you got the right version

1: Handgun (handgunfrompaint), Its a 17 shot semi automatic pistol i drawn myself in ms paint, ~might crash your game, problem because of the sound or some shit idk~ bug fixed, for some reason i forgot to put in the sound file and instead of playing no sound it just crashes your game gunshot came from me just saying "pew"

2: Combat Handgun (Tracedgun) A Gun traced from google images into paint, its a 19 shot, witht he sound coming from a glock 19 police bodycam

3: Snub Nose (lazyrevovler) Was originally just meant to be the image, but it didn't worked so its just traced, 6 shots, gun shot game from some random sfx website

4: Tactical Shotgun (robloxshotgun) The shotgun gear from roblox, 5 shots, delayed each shots instead of using pump action since the pump sound is immiedietly played with the gunshot sound, gunshot is the roblox shotgun gun sound from the trench gun

4: AT48 (badak) A AK-47, Also traced, AT48 Name from Karlson aka dani, High recoil, 30 shots, gunshot is the just the base Madness Interactive reloaded one

5: Glock 17 (imageglock) I managed to make it, just the image, 17 shots, sound is just a sfx on youtube. thats it

more guns are soon to be added
