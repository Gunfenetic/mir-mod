A Mod thats adds 5 guns, will add more (if i feel like it)

1: Handgun (Handgunfrompaint), A Gun i drew in MS Paint, thats it, its a Semi automatic Pistol with 17 rounds, semi automatic (Dont use for some reason it crashes your game if you shoot)
2: Combat Handgun (tracedgun), A Gun i traced by adding image into ms paint and tracing it basically, based on one of the handguns Taurus Made, Uses Gunshots form police bodycam of a glock 19
3: Snub Nose Revolver (lazyrevolver), A Revolver, which originally just meant to be the image (thats why its called lazyrevolver) but it wouldn't worked so i just traced it, 6 rouds, sound came from some random sfx websites
4: Tactical Shotgun (robloxshotgun), based on the tactical shotgun from roblox, it has 5 rounds, its not pump because the pump sounds plays during the gunshot sound effect, the sound is a editted version of the actual roblox gun sound of it
5: AT-48 (badak) yes i took it from karlson, its just the revolver or combat handgun, tis traced, 30 rounds, fully automatic, the sound is just one of the base ak sfx
